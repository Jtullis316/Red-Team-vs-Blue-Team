# Red-Team-vs-Blue-Team

For this project, I worked on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable Virtual Machine within my environment, and ultimately gained root access to the machine. As Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken from when I attacked the vulernable machine. I then used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report.
I created mitigation measures for each exploit that I've successfully performed.
